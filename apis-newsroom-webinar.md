The Sunlight Foundation offers free APIs for a number of our tools and projects. Our six APIs (or application programming interfaces) are a great resource for news developers, researchers and reporters. Our APIs cover a variety of topics from what Congress says daily to upcoming bills in a state assembly to whom issues federal rulemaking comments.

<ul>
<li>Capitol Words API</li>
<li>Congress API v3</li>
<li>*new!* Docket Wrench API</li>
<li>Influence Explorer API</li>
