<a href="http://www.opencongress.org/">OpenCongress</a> is a free, open source tool that allows you to explore the workings of Congress from searching for legislation, identifying popular bills, browsing voting records to finding and connecting with your lawmaker. The project, originally launched by the Participatory Politics Foundation, is now a project of Sunlight Foundation. The webinar covered ways to optimize OpenCongress for your use, from creating issue specific widgets, comparing voting records between two lawmakers (“head to head” function), setting email alerts for federal bills and creating a user account.

The session also explored the data that powers OpenCongress and provided insight on how we developed the tool while soliciting feedback on future functionalities.
