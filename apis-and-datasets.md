In this session geared toward newsroom developers, you will learn how to access the Sunlight Foundation's APIs and bulk data to create customized, local news apps. Most of Sunlight's tools — Influence Explorer, Open States, Party Time — and more, have APIs accessible to anyone. Our developers will walk you through how to use them.

Here are the datasets we covered:
