With the 2014 elections just around the corner, the Sunlight Foundation hosted this webinar to follow the money in congressional races regardless of your technical expertise. This session featured the Real-Time Federal Campaign Finance tracker, a component of Influence Explorer, that allows you to search committees, candidates and races and get the latest campaign finance totals. We showed how to download the data as well as get up-to-the-minute alerts on reports filed by super PACs and other outside groups with the Federal Election Commission.

This in-depth tutorial highlights how to get the most of these resources as you cover campaigns as well as provide practical how-tos, ideas for stories and feature examples of current use cases of the data from ongoing races.
