<h1>Political Ad Information at Your Finger Tip (webinar)</h1>

Recorded webinar from October 23, 2012. Learn how to use Ad Hawk as a research tool to create effective searches, understand campaign finance data, and discover how to analyze this year's political ads.

Political ads are saturating our airwaves. That is why we built <a href="http://adhawk.sunlightfoundation.com">Ad Hawk</a>, a free mobile and web app that identifies information about who is buying political ads using audio fingerprint technology. The tool lets you know who placed the ads, their campaign finance profile and other election information. The political ads are archived on <a href="http://adhawk.sunlightfoundation.com">Ad Hawk</a> and are also available in a searchable database.
