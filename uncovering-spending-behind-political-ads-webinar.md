<a id="internal-source-marker_0.047632401384445466" href="http://politicaladsleuth.com/">Political Ad Sleuth</a> is a project dedicated to posting online the information available in the “political files” of all U.S. broadcast stations. This file includes a record of political advertising buys, and contains information about the advertiser’s name, cost of the buy and date range for the ads.

Until this year, these records have been kept on paper at the headquarters of TV stations (often their broadcast studios), rendering them inaccessible to all but the most tenacious members of the public. For the first time, the Federal Communications Commission is putting some of the files online. Sunlight, in partnership with Free Press, are recruiting volunteers to free the rest of the files.
