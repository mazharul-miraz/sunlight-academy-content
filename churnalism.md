<a href="http://churnalism.sunlightfoundation.com/">Churnalism</a> searches the text you enter against a large corpus of press releases and determines the best match. Sometimes, exact fragments will match that are clearly not plagiarism. These often include expanded organizational names (such as The United States House of Representatives) or boilerplate copy about a particular company that is usually appended to the end of each press release. In order to filter out uninteresting matches and provide the best user experience, we use a relevancy ranking that is derived from the total character overlap, and the density of that overlap.
