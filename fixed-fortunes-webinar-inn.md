How much do the biggest donors to political campaigns get out of Washington? When firms put millions into the political process, and get tens of billions out, is there an appearance of corruption? The Sunlight Foundation <a href="http://influenceexplorer.com/fixed-fortunes/">examined</a> a subset of large campaign contributors—the 200 biggest givers among for-profit corporations (of course, we mean their executives and political action committees)—and looked at their financial relationship with the federal government.

In this webinar, we reviewed data we've assembled from federal budget documents and legislation to show you how special interests, Congress and the executive branch interact to bring home the bacon in a post-earmark era. Find companies in your area whose defense business is baked into the federal budget. And while we've looked at historical data (from FY 2008 through FY 2013), the methodology can be applied to the upcoming procurement season.

This webinar is hosted by the Sunlight Foundation for the Investigative News Network.
