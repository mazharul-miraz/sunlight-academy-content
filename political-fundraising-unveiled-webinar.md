Virtually every day, candidates and the incumbents they want to unseat are holding breakfast, lunch and happy-hour fundraisers and Party Time tells you when and where they are taking place. Since its start in 2008, <a href="http://politicalpartytime.org">Party Time</a> has chronicled fundraisers happening in D.C. and around the U.S. and is the central clearinghouse of information for journalists, citizen journalists, activists and voters who are interested in following the money -- and the influence it carries.

This webinar covered <a href="http://politicalpartytime.org">Party Time</a> and how to search the database of fundraiser inviters, whether it be by candidate, host, location, party theme or VIPs in attendance. The session also provided insight on how to use the data to discover patterns in giving in the most comprehensive listing of political fundraisers available.
